1. controller
   - Implement handler functions for each endpoint defined in the API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for /users and /users/{userId}).
   - Parse request body and parameters, call the appropriate usecase function, and format the response.

2. dao
   - Implement functions to interact with the database. These should include functions to get a list of users, get a user by ID, create a new user, update a user, and delete a user.

3. model
   - The User struct is already defined according to the database schema. No further features need to be implemented in this package.

4. usecase
   - Implement functions that use the dao to perform operations related to the business logic. These should include functions to get a list of users, get a user by ID, create a new user, update a user, and delete a user. Each function should take the necessary parameters, call the appropriate dao function, and return the result.

5. main
   - Set up routes for each endpoint defined in the API, associating each route with the appropriate handler function from the controller.
   - Handle any necessary server setup and teardown, such as loading environment variables and opening and closing the database connection.

1. Define the data model: The `model.go` file is currently empty. You need to define the data structures that represent the entities in your application. These structures will be used to map the data from the database to Go objects.

2. Implement the DAO methods: The `dao.go` file currently only contains methods for opening and closing the database connection. You need to implement the methods for interacting with the database, such as `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, and any other methods specific to your application.

3. Implement the use cases: The `usecase.go` file is currently empty. You need to implement the business logic of your application in this file. This typically involves calling the appropriate DAO methods and applying any necessary transformations to the data.

4. Implement the controller methods: The `controller.go` file is currently empty. You need to implement the methods that handle HTTP requests and responses. These methods should call the appropriate use case methods and return the results in the appropriate format (usually JSON).

5. Set up routing: In the `main.go` file, you need to set up the routes for your application. This involves mapping URLs to controller methods.

6. Error handling: You need to add appropriate error handling throughout your code. This includes handling errors returned by the DAO methods, use case methods, and any errors that occur during the handling of HTTP requests.

7. Testing: You need to write tests for your code to ensure that it works as expected. This includes unit tests for the DAO methods and use case methods, as well as integration tests for the controller methods.

8. Documentation: You need to document your code and your API. This includes comments in the code explaining what each method does, as well as a README file explaining how to use your API.

9. Environment Variables: Ensure all necessary environment variables are properly loaded and used in the application. 

10. Data Validation: Implement data validation to ensure that the data sent in requests is in the correct format and meets any other requirements your application has.

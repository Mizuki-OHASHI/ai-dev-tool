1. Define the necessary data structures in the `model.go` file that will represent the tables in the database.
2. Implement the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the `dao.go` file for interacting with the database.
3. In the `usecase.go` file, implement the business logic that will use the CRUD operations defined in the `dao.go` file.
4. In the `controller.go` file, define the necessary HTTP handlers that will handle the incoming HTTP requests, use the business logic defined in the `usecase.go` file, and send back the HTTP responses.
5. In the `main.go` file, register the HTTP handlers defined in the `controller.go` file to their respective routes.
6. Also in the `main.go` file, make sure to load the environment variables, open the database connection, and start the HTTP server.
7. Test the application to make sure everything is working as expected.
8. Document the code and the API.
9. Handle possible errors and edge cases.
10. Optimize the code for performance if necessary.

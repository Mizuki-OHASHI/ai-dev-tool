You have n cards numbered from 1 to n. Let's assume that a positive integer a_i is written on card i. Write a function called countCardCombinations to output the number of ways to select some cards from the set and make the sum of the integers written on them equal to s (>0).

func countCardCombinations(s int, a int[]) int

func main() {
  if countCardCombinations(15, []int{1,3,3,4,5,5,5,7,10}) != 19 {
    panic(fmt.Errorf())
  }
}
